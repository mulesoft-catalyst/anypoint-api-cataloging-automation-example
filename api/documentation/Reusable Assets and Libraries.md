This page is focusing on all reusable assets which were part of this API implementation. These reusable assets and libraries could be:

- Common Fragments/Traits
- Compliance definitions
- Jars/classes or Drivers
- Any point Connectors (Custom connectors developed by the organisations are the most important to be stated)
- Any resources (CSS, HTMLs, Images or icons) used within the API or within the documentation (incl. the copy rights)
