This page is setting the API context on a technical level highlighting:

- The main features provided by the API
- Combined with diagrams:
    - How the api fits in overall technical landscape – Big picture
    - 4+1 architecture models (Not everything, only what’s adding a value to consumers)
        - This can be set of Use cases/ Sequence Diagrams shows how it fits in customer journey from technical point of view
        - Customer journey through this API. It’s highly recommended to use API-led connectivity approach for diagramming it
        - Physical view of how the service is deployed. This important for consumers to understand their backend service capabilities and architecture and tune the communicated data in a proper way enable faster delivery. This including but not limit to (the hosting infrastructure, firewalls, any communication blockage, etc)
